You have a business that ships liquids in cylindrically shaped containers.
Your shipping charges are a function of the amount of the liquid in a container.
Assume each is filled to the brim and that you also offer the option to paint the
outside of the container for an additional cost. Write a program that:
Asks the user to enter 1) the radius of the base and the height in feet of the
container, 2) the shipping cost per liter, 3) the paint cost per square foot.

For your output, show the shipping cost and the cost of painting. Your program 
will use the class cylinderType given to you on canvas to store the radius and 
height of the container. Use 1 cubic feet is 28.3168 liters or 1 liter is 0.353146667 
cubic feet.)
