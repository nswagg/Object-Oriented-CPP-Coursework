Employee and ProductionWorker classes

A factory you recently wrote code for has received a Federal grant 
that compensates the pay of disabled folk working at the factory. 
The point is to encourage factories to hire those that are disabled 
and give them an opportunity to work. Design a class named Employee. 
The class should keep the following information in
   • Employee name
   • Employee number
   • Hire date
   • Disabled (yes or no)
Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and 
mutator functions for the class. Next, write a class named 
ProductionWorker that is derived from the Employee class. The ProductionWorker 
class should have member variables to hold the following information:
  • Shift (an integer)
  • Hourly pay rate (a double )
The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift 
variable will hold an integer value representing the shift that the 
employee works. The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift is 
shift 2. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and
mutator functions for the class. Demonstrate the classes by writing a
program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
