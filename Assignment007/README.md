Note: The FeetInches C++ source file was made available
at time of creating WaggonerN14.13
I cannot take credit for FeetInches, its header, or the other
header files,  RoomCarpet.h and RoomDimension.h 
attached to make 14.13 run as they were provided in our textbook
I implemented the FeetInches simplify() and multiply() functions
