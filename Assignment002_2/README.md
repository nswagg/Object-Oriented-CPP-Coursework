Write a program that generates an array of 50 components. You will first 
ask the user to enter 50 integers. At this point the user can either 
1) enter 50 integers manually or 2) paste these 50 integers below. 

Once the aforementioned 50 integers are entered, the program stores
them into an array of 50 components. The program then determines and 
outputs which numbers in the array are the sum of any two other array elements. 
If an array element is the sum of two other array elements, then for this array 
element, the program should output all such pairs.
