A painting company has determined that for every 110 square feet of wall space,
1 gallon of paint and 8 hours of labor will be required. The company charges $25.00
per hour for labor. Write a modular program that allows the user to enter the number
of rooms that are to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also ask
for the square feet of wall space in each room. It should then display the following data:

-The number of gallons of paint required
-The hours of labor required
-The cost of the paint
-The labor charges
-The total cost of the paint job
Note:
Input Validation: The program should not accept a value of less than 1 for the number of rooms.
It should not accept a value of less than $10.00 for the price of paint. Do not accept a negative value
for square footage of wall space.
