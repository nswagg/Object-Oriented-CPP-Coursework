Write a program that simultates inventory bins in a warehouse. 
Each bin holds a number of the same type of parts. The program
should use a structure that keeps the following data:
      Description of the part kept in the bin
      Number of parts in the bin
The program should have an array of 10 bins

When the program runs, it should repeat a loop that performs
the following steps:
The user should see a list of what each bin holds and how many
parts are in the bin. The user can choose to either quit or 
select a bin. When the bin is selected, the user can either
add parts to it  or remove parts from it. The loop then repeats,
showing the updated bin data on screen.

Input Validation:
No bin can hold more than 30 parts, so don't let the usre add more
than a bin can hold. Also, don't accept negative values for the 
number of parts being added or removed.
